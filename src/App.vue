      How can we create a positive developer experience that helps the developer focus on building successful decentralized applications?
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This is the leading question that led us to the development of <strong>blace</strong>.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Numerous projects are being built or proposed in <a href="https://cardano.ideascale.com/" target="_blank">Project Catalyst</a> that aim to create decentralized marketplaces to serve as intermediaries between supply and demand, sellers and buyers, server and clients.

Just like their simpler Web 2.0 equivalents, blace enables scaffolding marketplaces with a simple <span class="font-mono bg-gray-500 text-white px-1">blace new</span>, thus cutting down development time and cost.
